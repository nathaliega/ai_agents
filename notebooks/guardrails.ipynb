      "\n",
      "4. **Political Conflicts**: There were ongoing political power struggles between the North and the South. The South feared losing political influence as new free states were added, which contributed to tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Sectionalism**: Both regions had developed distinct cultural, social, and economic identities, which fostered mutual distrust and hostility.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Election of Abraham Lincoln**: Lincoln's election in 1860 was seen as a threat by the South. Although he promised not to abolish slavery where it already existed, his opposition to its expansion alarmed Southern states, leading to secession.\n",
      "\n",
